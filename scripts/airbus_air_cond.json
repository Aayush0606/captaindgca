Then, the cooled bleed air enters the compressor section of the air-cycle machine and is compressed to a higher pressure and temperature. It is cooled again in the main heat exchanger and enters the turbine section, where it expands and, in expanding, generates power to drive the compressor and cooling air fan. The removal of energy during this process reduces air temperature, resulting in very low air temperature at turbine discharge.

    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "After the engine start, the Pack Flow Control Valves automatically open. However, on the ground, the reopening of these valves is delayed for a specific period after the first engine start, depending on the aircraft’s Manufacturer Serial Number (MSN) range. Specifically: For aircraft within the MSN ranges of 02624-02907, 03271-03305, 03344, 03551, 03620-03687, 03822-03918, 03970, 04020-04052, 04089, 04121, 04164-04237, and 06446-06803, the reopening of the valves on the ground is delayed for 30 seconds to prevent an additional pack closure cycle during the second engine start. For aircraft within the MSN ranges of 07459-08167 and 08202-08917, this delay is extended to 60 seconds for the same reason. The purpose of this delay is to avoid an unnecessary pack closure cycle when the second engine is started. The pack flow control valve typically closes immediately on the starting engine side if the crossbleed valve is closed, when the engine mode selector is set to IGN (or CRK), and remains closed until N2 is less than 50%. If the crossbleed valve is open during engine start, both pack flow control valves will close."

    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "According to the sources, the ram air inlet flap’s behaviour during takeoff and landing is as follows: The ram air inlet flap closes during takeoff and landing. The primary reason for this closure is to avoid the ingestion of foreign matter. During takeoff, the flap closes when takeoff power is set and the main landing gear struts are compressed. During landing, it closes as soon as the main landing gear struts are compressed, provided the speed is at or above 70 kt. It then opens 20 seconds after the speed drops below 70 kt. Therefore, the flaps are designed to close, not remain open, during these high-power phases to protect the system."

    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "The temperature in each aircraft zone is controlled by the Air Conditioning System Controllers (ACSC). Temperature regulation is further optimized through the modulation of specific components. Specifically, the sources state: Temperature regulation is optimized via the hot air pressure regulating valve, and the trim air valves. The Hot-Air Pressure-Regulating Valve regulates the pressure of hot air, which is tapped upstream of the packs. This valve is regulated by ACSC 1. The Trim Air Valves are electrically controlled by the zone controller or the ACSC. A trim air valve is associated with each zone and adjusts the temperature by adding hot air. For instance, the cockpit trim air valve is controlled by ACSC 1, and the cabin trim air valves are controlled by ACSC 2. Therefore, considering the question’s emphasis on “each aircraft zone” and the direct role of the trim air valves in adjusting temperature for individual zones, the most precise answer among the given options is the Zone Trim Air Valve."

    "explanation": "The trim air valves play a crucial role in optimising the temperature within each aircraft zone. As you’ve noted, there is one trim air valve associated with each zone: the Cockpit, Forward Cabin, and Aft Cabin. Here’s how they optimise the temperature: The Air Conditioning System Controllers (ACSC) or the zone controller control these valves electrically. Their primary function is to adjust the temperature by adding hot air. This hot air is tapped from upstream of the packs. Specifically, the cockpit trim air valve is controlled by ACSC 1, while the cabin trim air valves (for FWD and AFT cabin) are controlled by ACSC 2. In essence, the trim air valves fine-tune the temperature for individual zones by mixing precise amounts of hot air with the conditioned air supplied from the mixing unit. This allows the system to achieve and maintain the selected temperature for each of the independently controlled zones."

Source explicitly states: “When the EXTRACT pushbutton switch is set at OVRD, the extract fan is controlled directly from the pushbutton. Both fans continue to run.” Air-conditioning air is added for ventilation. When either the BLOWER or EXTRACT pushbutton switch is in the OVRD position, “Air from the air conditioning system is added to ventilation air”. The Avionics ventilation system goes into Closed Config. When either the BLOWER or EXTRACT pushbutton switch is in the OVRD position, “The system goes to closed circuit configuration”. Therefore, options 2, 3, and 4 describe what happens. Option 1, “Extract Fan stops,” is incorrect.

    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "Based on the provided sources and our conversation history, the primary pushbutton directly related to operating in heavy rain for landing is the Rain Repellent (RAIN RPLNT) pushbutton (pb). While the sources do not provide a detailed procedure for landing in heavy rain, the presence of the RAIN RPLNT pb and the mention of the Rain Repellent System indicate that this system is intended for managing rain on the windshield. The Rain Repellent System can be activated (or reactivated, as mentioned in the context of “fluid compatible with ozone protection rules”) via its dedicated pushbutton. Other systems mentioned in the context of rain or weather include: Wiper Intermittent Position: Wipers are a general function for clearing rain, and “Wiper Intermittent Position” is listed as being related to “RAIN”. However, the specific action of pressing a “P/B” for wipers is not explicitly detailed; wipers are typically controlled by a switch with various positions. Weather Radar System (WXR): The aircraft is equipped with a weather radar system capable of Predictive Windshear (PWS) function, which aids in detecting adverse weather. However, this is for detection rather than a control (pushbutton) to be pressed for landing in rain. Pack Flow Selector: While the “PACK FLOW selector” can be used to choose pack valve flow according to “ambient conditions (smoke removal, hot or wet conditions)”, this relates to air conditioning flow and not a direct control for managing rain during landing."

    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "When the Thrust Levers are set to FLX/MCT for takeoff and the Outside Air Temperature (OAT) is +40°C, the avionics ventilation system will be in the closed-circuit configuration. Here’s why: The avionics ventilation system operates automatically. When the BLOWER and EXTRACT pushbutton switches are in the normal “AUTO” position, the system’s configuration depends on the operational phase. During ground operations after the application of takeoff power, the ventilation system automatically transitions to a closed-circuit configuration. This condition applies when the thrust levers are set to FLX/MCT for takeoff. While an OAT of +40°C is high and might typically lead to an open-circuit configuration during general ground operations (where the skin temperature is above +12°C), the specific action of applying takeoff power (setting thrust levers to FLX/MCT) overrides other ground-based temperature thresholds, forcing the system into the closed-circuit configuration for the takeoff phase."

This message specifically appears in situations involving failures of the Flight Management and Guidance Computers (FMGCs): It may be triggered by the Flight Warning System (FWS) in the event of a single latch FMGC failure. A “single latch” occurs when one FMGC fails and latches, leading to single mode operation. It is displayed when both FMGCs become inoperative (dual latch), indicating a loss of FM and FG capability, along with other critical system failures. The message is also presented after a dual FMGS reset with loss of data and autorecovery, particularly after four successive dual resets within 3 minutes, which results in the erasure of all pilot-entered data."

    "explanation": "Based on the provided sources, there is no explicit mention of a recommended maximum flight level (FL) specifically for a “Pack 1 and 2 Fault”. However, the sources do provide information about: Recommended Maximum Altitude (REC MAX): This altitude is displayed on the PROG page and is the lowest maximum altitude the aircraft can reach while maintaining a 0.3 g buffet margin, flying level at MAX CRZ rating, or maintaining a V/S of 300 ft/min at MAX CLB thrust, among other criteria. It is limited to FL 398. Anti-ice is not considered for this computation. Engine-Out Condition: If one engine is out, the REC MAX altitude displayed on the PROG page is the recommended maximum engine-out altitude, which is computed based on the long-range cruise speed and assumes anti-ice is off. While the FCOM excerpts detail how engine-out conditions affect the recommended maximum altitude, and they mention pack fault indications, they do not specify a corresponding maximum flight level for a complete loss of both air conditioning packs."
