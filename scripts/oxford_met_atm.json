The higher it is, the colder the temperature at the tropopause. The lower it is, the warmer the temperature at the tropopause. The temperature at the tropopause can be as high as -40°C over the poles and as low as -80°C over the equator. However, on average the tropopause is at about 11 km where its temperature is -56.5°C."
